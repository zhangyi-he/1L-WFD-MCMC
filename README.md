# Inferring natural selection and gene migration in the evolution of chickens from ancient DNA data

Source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for detecting and quantifying natural selection at two linked loci from time series data of allele frequencies through forward-in-time simulations, and the preprint has been submitted to bioRxiv available at .

v1.0 includes the source code implemented for the case that joint estimation of the allele frequency trajectories of the underlying population is not allowed.

v1.1 includes the source code implemented for the case that joint estimation of the allele frequency trajectories of the underlying population is allowed.

REAL includes the real data for ancient chicken and the source code tailed to the analysis of TSHR and BCDO2.
