# Inferring natural selection and gene migration in the evolution of chickens from ancient DNA data
Source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for inferring the timing and strength of natural selection and gene migration from time series data of allele frequencies, and the preprint has been submitted to bioRxiv available at .

v1.0 includes the source code implemented for the case that joint estimation of the allele frequency trajectories of the underlying population is not allowed.

v1.1 includes the source code implemented for the case that joint estimation of the allele frequency trajectories of the underlying population is allowed.

REAL includes the source code tailed to the analysis of TSHR and BCDO2, including the aDNA dataset for chickens.
